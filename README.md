Slate.js
--------------------

Slate.js is a web framework written in JavaScript to develop modular HTML5 applications. The most of the design decisions are based on my own personal experience with designing single-page web applications. (If you don't know what are Single Page Web apps, then watch your Gmail account or Google Maps page online). Along with this I taken some polished suggestions and improvements from the Nicolas Zakas research on developing web application framework in javaScript.


How to build it?
-----------------------

In order to use it directly from source, you may first require to build it. Its fun and easy to build a library from a source on your own machine and use it!! For this, you may need to install Node.js on your machine. and then clone the project:

    >$ git clone https://github.com/ashish-chopra/slatejs.git

Then browse to `slatejs` doler in command line and then type

    >$ npm install -g grunt-cli
    >$ npm install

This will install grunt task runner cli and all the project dependencies.
Once done, fire a command `grunt`; this will build the file in `dist/` directory.
You can use this JavaScript file at in any of your web application project.
